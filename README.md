# ProductLandingPage_ResponseWebDesign-CertificationProject-FreeCodeCamp
ProductLandingPage is a certification from a course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), which it's called "Response Web Design" (which you can check [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)).

The main goal of this project it's to put into use the different skills that wwe have learned until that point in time, creating a web similar to [this one](https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks).
In my case I decided that I wanted to give an upgrade to the page, so it can be more responsive, and better for navigation in general. 

You can see a preview of the page [here](https://product-landing-freecodecamp.onrender.com).
